# C_PRACTICE
## 1.C++ programming parctice : Greedy Snake (Nibbles)

This file is a Greedy Snake game. Use the up, down, left and right keys to control the snake and eat as many stars as you can!
Have fun.

## Design Idea
There are several necessary class in this C++ code:
1. sanke_position class: a 2 dimension data structure to store the position of sanke body
2. snake class: used to control the movement and growth of the snake
3. Board class: used to generate the gameboard for the greedy sanke
4. Food class: used to control the action of food
5. Game class: act as the center control unit, which is used to refresh the game frame and control the game process

## Interaction between Different Parts
1. Create a Game object which includes 3 objects: snake, food, board
2. The parameters of each object are called and used by the Game object


## 2.C++ programming parctice : Russian Blocks
